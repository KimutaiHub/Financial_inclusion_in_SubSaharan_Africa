        "### 1.2 Business Context\n",
        "\n",
        "Financial inclusion is a key driver of economic development, poverty reduction, and household resilience. Access to formal financial services—such as bank accounts—enables households to save securely, receive payments, access credit, manage risks, and withstand economic shocks. In Kenya and Sub-Saharan Africa, many households remain financially excluded due to structural and socio-economic barriers including education level, employment type, rural/urban access, gender dynamics, household characteristics, and limited access to digital tools such as mobile phones. Governments, banks, fintech firms, insurers, and development organizations invest in inclusion programs, but success depends on accurate targeting and evidence-driven product and policy design. This project uses household-level survey data and machine learning to understand and predict bank account ownership, generating actionable insights to improve inclusion strategies and strengthen household resilience.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.3 Business Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite ongoing financial inclusion initiatives, a significant share of households remain unbanked. Stakeholders need analytical tools to:\n",
        "\n",
        "identify populations most likely to adopt formal financial services,\n",
        "\n",
        "understand the drivers of exclusion and adoption, and\n",
        "\n",
        "design targeted products and interventions (e.g., low-cost accounts, agent banking expansion, mobile-enabled onboarding, financial literacy programs).\n",
        "Without data-driven segmentation and prediction, resources can be misallocated and programs may deliver limited measurable impact.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.4 Project Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "This project aims to build an end-to-end analytics solution that:\n",
        "\n",
        "Predicts financial inclusion by classifying whether a household respondent owns a bank account (bank_account).\n",
        "\n",
        "Identifies key drivers of bank account ownership across demographic, social, and economic factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Produces actionable segmentation to support stakeholder targeting (e.g., groups with low inclusion probability and shared barriers).\n",
        "\n",
        "Generates stakeholder-ready outputs including interpretable model results, country-specific insights (especially Kenya), and reporting-ready datasets for dashboards.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.5 Stakeholders and Intended Users\n",
        "\n",
        "Primary stakeholders and users include:\n",

        "Banks & Microfinance Institutions: customer acquisition, branch/agent placement, product pricing, and onboarding strategy\n",
        "\n",

        "The dataset is survey-based and may not include direct income, consumption, or shock exposure measures.\n",

        "Risks and Mitigations\n",

        "Risk: class imbalance → use stratified split and report ROC-AUC, precision/recall, and confusion matrix.\n",

        "Risk: country heterogeneity → include country as a feature and also assess Kenya-only performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Risk: interpretability needs → include Logistic Regression baseline and clear feature importance reporting.\n"

Default is 'lbfgs'.<br>To choose a solver, you might want to consider the following aspects:<br><br>- 'lbfgs' is a good default solver because it works reasonably well for a wide<br>  class of problems.<br>- For :term:`multiclass` problems (`n_classes >= 3`), all solvers except<br>  'liblinear' minimize the full multinomial loss, 'liblinear' will raise an<br>  error.<br>- 'newton-cholesky' is a good choice for<br>  `n_samples` >> `n_features * n_classes`, especially with one-hot encoded<br>  categorical features with rare categories. Be aware that the memory usage<br>  of this solver has a quadratic dependency on `n_features * n_classes`<br>  because it explicitly computes the full Hessian matrix.<br>- For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag'<br>  and 'saga' are faster for large ones;<br>- 'liblinear' can only handle binary classification by default. To apply a<br>  one-versus-rest scheme for the multiclass setting one can wrap it with the<br>  :class:`~sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier`.<br><br>.. warning::<br>   The choice of the algorithm depends on the penalty chosen (`l1_ratio=0`<br>   for L2-penalty, `l1_ratio=1` for L1-penalty and `0 < l1_ratio < 1` for<br>   Elastic-Net) and on (multinomial) multiclass support:<br><br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   solver            l1_ratio                 multinomial multiclass<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   'lbfgs'           l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'liblinear'       l1_ratio=1 or l1_ratio=0 no<br>   'newton-cg'       l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'newton-cholesky' l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'sag'             l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'saga'            0<=l1_ratio<=1           yes<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br><br>.. note::<br>   'sag' and 'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features<br>   with approximately the same scale.
